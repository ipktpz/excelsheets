# excelsheets

This script helps users combine multiple Excel sheets into a single file. It is based on household lists collected under the framework of the Maji Bora Safe Water Supply Projects in Turkana and Kilifi counties in Kenya. In Turkana, we have rehabilitated approximately 205 boreholes, of which we have selected 37 and collected data on the households that use them. In Kilifi, we have rehabilitated over 360 boreholes, sampled 37 of them, and collected data on the households they serve. We are now working to combine all these household lists from the sampled boreholes into one Excel sheet, instead of having them in 37 separate sheets.
